## Features

- Each stroke is stored automatically on your Urbit.
- Export Canvas Images as SVG.
  - Image files are stored on S3 Storage, if configured.
- Allows creation of Public/Private Canvas.
  - Others can join a Public Canvas and work collaboratively in a cool art project.

## Access

A public canvas is hosted at

```hoon
~master-norsyr-torryn/canvas
```

Come and join the first public Urbit Canvas!

## Installation

Copy and commit the contents of the urbit folder to your pier.

- First you need to mount the desk from where you will run canvas (e.g. by running `> |mount /=home=` from your urbit
- You copy all the frontend and backend files using the `install.sh` script: `install.sh <PATH_TO_THE_MOUNTED_DESK>`

You can also sync from the moon's home desk, without interacting with the file system (this is still experimental, so trying this on a planet is not recommendedâ€”use a comet or a moon instead)

```hoon
|sync %home ~master-norsyr-torryn %home
```

## Running

Once you have all the source code downloaded:

```dojo
> |start %canvas
```

Then navigate to `YOUR_URBIT_URL/~canvas` (if you are running locally, this is usually: `http://localhost:8080/~canvas`)
